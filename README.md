# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO
#### Algorithm and mini Projects/programs

- Codes are grouped into folders based on the languages/framework used, and may be further grouped based on individual projects, type or style
- most codes here howerver, if not all, will be basic and may even include 3rd party libraries but hardly frameworks. projects done on frameworks will most probably be kept on their own separate repository.
- feel free to use the codes this repo as you wish. no referencing or special permissions required
- feel free to propose changes, ask questions, comment. That's totally acceptable, warmly welcomed and cherished.
- thank you :)
